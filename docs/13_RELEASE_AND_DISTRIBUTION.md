# 13 — Release and Distribution

## Independent artifacts

Version separately:

1. application engine;
2. language packs;
3. model bundles;
4. optional voice packs.

## Desktop release

Target signed/packaged releases for Linux, Windows, and macOS after platform gates pass. Linux is the primary development reference but not the only 1.0 target.

## Mobile

Tauri 2 supports Android/iOS targets, but mobile is a separate milestone because microphone permissions, app-store packaging, model memory/storage, background behavior, and native dependencies need validation.

## Web/PWA

A web build may offer reduced-capability learning. Do not weaken privacy promises or force cloud speech solely to claim browser parity.

## Update channels

- stable;
- beta;
- development/nightly.

Reference language-pack updates can ship independently after compatibility validation.

## Model registry

Maintain a signed/verified metadata registry or static catalog describing compatible model bundles. Downloads are resumable and checksummed.

## First-run downloads

Base app should remain reasonably small. Prompt for optional speech/TTS model download only when the user selects capabilities needing them. Display size, privacy/local status, and hardware recommendation.

## Reproducibility

CI should produce checksums, SBOM/dependency reports where practical, release notes, and pack/model manifests.

## Release candidate and publication

`REL-001` produces a reviewable release candidate. Distribution to public channels, signing credentials and paid/store accounts require owner authorization. Resolve the source-code/original-content licenses before public redistribution. Mobile, optional AI, web and advanced content do not gate the desktop candidate.

All final audit reports bind to the exact application commit/build configuration, dependency lockfiles, pack hashes, model/provider hashes, review range, platform and hardware tiers. An affected update invalidates its previous evidence and reruns the relevant gates. Publish aggregate benchmark/review evidence without private recordings or reviewer identities.

## Authentic updates and interrupted downloads

Application updates use authenticated signed metadata/artifacts when that update channel exists; checksum-only metadata obtained from the same untrusted location is not publisher authentication. Trusted pack/model catalogs bind source URL, version, license/terms, size and digest to an authenticated catalog record. Third-party unsigned packs remain explicitly lower trust. Signature indicates publisher/integrity, not linguistic correctness.

Downloads stage to temporary storage, enforce length/hash limits, resume safely, support cancel, and activate atomically only after validation. Interrupted/disk-full/invalid-signature downloads keep the last working version. Keys live outside source/pack files; document rotation and recovery. Release-mode artifacts contain no debug driver or elevated test hooks. See the [Tauri updater reference](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/) when that provider is chosen.
